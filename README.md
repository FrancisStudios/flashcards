# flashcards by FrancisStudios 🎴

Flashcards are a proven method of learning vocabulary. Increase your success in learning a new language or definitions by writing them on flashcards, so you can continously test yourself. 

I wrote **flashcards** primarily for friends and for myself, but I decided to open up this project to the internet, so other people can benefit from this app. You can access the source code here, you can contribute to this project. Please read the [contribution page](./docs/contributing.md).
