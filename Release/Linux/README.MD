# How to run file?

If you need to give privileges to the executable use the chmod command before trying to launch the app. The executable should create a folder with the name 'flashcards' next to itself, where all the saves are stored

```sh
chmod + x flashcards_tux_2.1.5.x86_64
./flashcards_tux_2.1.5.x86_64
```
